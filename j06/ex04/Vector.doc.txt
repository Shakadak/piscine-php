The Vector classe handle vectors.

In order to construct an instance, you have to provide an array containing the following:
'dest' => Vertex: The ending point of the vector.
'orig' => [Vertex:optionnal]: The starting point of the vector.
	By default, the origin of the space containing the vector.

The class propose the following methods:

float magnitude()
Return the norm of the vector.

Vector normalize()
Return a new vector normalized to its normed vector space.

Vector add(Vector $rhs)
Return the sum of tho vector.

Vector sub(Vector $rhs)
Return the substraction of two vector.

Vector opposite()
Return the opposite of the vector.

Vector scalarProduct($k)
Return the result of the scalar product between the vector and the scalar value.

float dotProduct(Vector $rhs)
Return the dot product of the vectors.

float cos(Vector $rhs)
Return the cosine angle between the two vector.

Vector crossProduct(Vector $rhs)
Return the result of the crossProduct between two vectors.
