The Vertex class handles x, y, z, w coordinates as well as the Color class.

An instance can be constructed by providing x, y and z value, with w,
and colors optionally:
new Vertex(array('x' => 1, 'y' => 2, 'z' => 3[, 'w' => 1.0][, 'color' => $C]));

The Class provide get and set methods for each attribute of the class.
Namely:
	X
	Y
	Z
	W
	Color
