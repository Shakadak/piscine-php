The Matrix classe handle 4x4 matrices.

In order to be able to construct a new instance, you will need to pass the following to the constructor:
An array containing these keywords:
	'preset'	=> CONST:	Contain one of the following class constant. From these depend what will the others
							parameters be.
	Matrix::SCALE
		'scale'	=> number:	The factor by wich the matrix generated will scale.
	Matrix::RX
	Matrix::RY
	Matrix::RZ
		'angle'	=> radians:	The angle by witch the rotation will be applied, corresponding to the given axe.
	Matrix::TRANSLATION
		'vtc'	=> Vector:	The vector that will apply the translation.
	Matrix::PROJECTION
		'fov'	=> degrees:	Field of view of the projection.
		'ratio'	=> number:	Ratio of the projected image.
		'near'	=> number:	Nearest plane for the projection.
		'far'	=> number:	Furthest plane for the projection.

The following methods can be used.

Matrix mult(Matrix $rhs)
Return a new matrix resulting from their multiplication.

Matrix transpose()
Return a new matrix resulting from the transposition of the current one.

Vertex transformVertex(Vertex $vtx)
Return the vertex resulting from the application of the matrix.

Triangle transformTriangle(Triangle $tri)
Return the triangle resulting from the application of the matrix.

array(Triangle) transformMesh(array(Triangle) $mesh)
Return the mesh resulting from the application of the matrix.
