The Camera class handle the transformation pipeline
from 3D to 2D.

In order to be able to construct a new instance, you will need to pass the following to the constructor:
An array containing these keywords:
	'origin'		=> Vertex:	This is where the camera will be positioned.
	'orientation'	=> Matrice:	This will rotate the camera in the correct direction.
	Either of these:
	{
		'width'		=> Number:	This will be used with 'height'.
		'height'	=> Number:	Represent the resolution.
	}
	or
	{
		'ratio'		=> Number:	The ratio of the image that will be captured by the camera.
	}
	'fov'			=> Angle:	The field of view captured by the camera. A value of 60 is generaly adviced.
	'near'			=> Number:	The distance from the camera where objects begin to appear.
	'far'			=> Number:	The distance from the camera where objects start to disappear.

	The following methods are available to operate various transformation.
	Vertex watchVertex(Vertex $worldVertex)
		Takes a vertex using world coordinate and transform it into a projected vertex, directly usable on screen.

	Triangle watchTriangle(Triangle $worldTriangle)
		Takes a triangle using world coordinate and transform it into a projected triangle.

	array(Triangle) watchMesh(array(Triangle) $worldMesh)
		Takes a mesh using world coordinate and transform it into a projected mesh.

	bool isVisible(Triangle $triangle)
		Takes a triangle and return wether it is facing the camera or not.
